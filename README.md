This repository contains the code and data that are used in the manuscript titled "Quantile regression estimates of body weight for walleye."

Users can clone the repo and run the analyses contained in the paper and evalute the output for themselves.

In addition to the code and data presented here, additional supplemental material can be found [here](https://stevenranney.shinyapps.io/slopeDistDemo/). The Shiny app at this link allows for exploration of the distribution of boostrapped replicates of slope from quantile regressions of walleye.
