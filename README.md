Manuscript and supporting material for paper on developing Ws equations with Quantile regression

---

This repository contains the code and data that are used in the manuscript titled "Quantile regression estimates of body weight for walleye", first submitted to the North American Journal of Fisheries Management on 17 Jan 2018.

Users can clone the repo and run the analyses contained in the paper and evalute the output for themselves.

In addition to the code and data presented here, additional supplemental material can be found [here](https://stevenranney.shinyapps.io/slopeDistDemo/). The Shiny app at this link allows for exploration of the distribution of boostrapped replicates of slope from quantile regressions of walleye.
